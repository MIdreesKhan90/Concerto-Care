        <h4 style="margin-top: 48px;">FAQs</h4>

        <h5 style="margin-top:24px;">Why is Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island offering this program?</h5>
        <p>Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island has set up the HouseCall by Blue program as part of its vision and commitment to improving its members’ health and well-being. The HouseCall by Blue program is meant to provide eligible Medicare Advantage plan members with a new option for convenient, in-home medical care and services that can help them manage their health.</p>

        <h5 style="margin-top:24px;">Am I eligible to be a part of this program?</h5>
        <p>Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island is initially offering the HouseCall by Blue program to a selected set of its members that it believes would be interested in and can benefit from in-home services provided. If you are eligible, you will have received a letter in the mail and may have also been contacted by phone. If you are a Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island Medicare Advantage plan member who did not receive any outreach, you can still call us at 888-966-3044 (TTY: 711) to find out if you are eligible.</p>

        <h5 style="margin-top:24px;">What happens next if I decide I want to join?</h5>
        <p>Once you decide you want to join the HouseCall by Blue program by calling us and letting us know at 888-966-3044 (TTY: 711), we take care of the rest in an easy three-step process:</p>

        <ol style="margin: 24px 0">
            <li><strong>We schedule you for your first in-home checkup visit</strong> – this is based on your schedule and needs</li>
            <li><strong>Before your first in-home visit,</strong> we give you a call to confirm your appointment and better understand your living space so that our team can plan in advance and provide the best care possible</li>
            <li><strong>During your first in-home visit, </strong>you sign a form confirming you’d like to be a part of the HouseCall by Blue program (that’s it – no long questionnaires to fill out) and then we conduct our initial check-up to better understand your health and needs</li>
        </ol>

        <p>From there, our teams work with you and your regular doctor to develop a detailed personal Care Plan that lays out what’s needed to manage your health and well-being. This could be anything from “traditional” medical care such as recommendations to see a specialist or help with following a certain medication regimen, to other supports like fitness recommendations, coaching sessions, or connections to community resources we think you would benefit from. Everything is <strong>personalized to you.</strong></p>
        <p>As long as you remain a member of the HouseCall by Blue program, you will have access to a whole team dedicated to your health and well-being, including regular in-home checkups, urgent visits, 24/7/365 phone access to our team, and so much more.</p>

        <h5 style="margin-top:24px;">I received outreach about the program but I’m healthy and rarely visit the doctor. Why should I join?</h5>
        <p>HouseCall by Blue is a personalized program of in-home care and services designed to meet each member’s individual goals and needs. For some members, this may mean more intensive support with managing one or more chronic conditions with a goal of reducing the number of “flare ups” that cause them to need to visit the hospital. For others, this may simply mean an annual in-home checkup and a little bit of coaching on how to keep their weight where they want and stay socially connected as their kids move away from home. There is no one size fits all.</p>
        <p>If you are healthy, the benefit of joining HouseCall by Blue today – even if you are still certain you don’t see an immediate need for it – is that it is an investment in your future and your peace of mind. In exchange for the hour or so it takes for you to complete the initial in-home visit with our team – during which you will likely learn things about your health that you did not know before – you will now have a team that intimately understands your health and is on call to serve you if ever the need arises. In the unlikely event that there is an unexpected change to your health, we all know how much easier it is in a time of need to call on a healthcare provider who already knows us. Even better if we know that provider is available 24/7/265, can come to our home, and we will not have to deal with any bills or paperwork before or after the visit.</p>
        <p>As a reminder, there is no cost to you for joining the HouseCall by Blue program, now or ever.</p>

        <h5 style="margin-top:24px;">What if I join and then decide the program is not for me?</h5>
        <p>HouseCall by Blue is a completely optional program that is offered as an “add-on” to everything you already have access to as a Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island member. Joining the program does not change your normal doctor, and it does not change any of your other existing benefits or services. So, if you decide to try HouseCall by Blue and then decide the program isn’t right for you, nothing will have changed and there will be no additional paperwork to fill out.</p>

        <h5 style="margin-top:24px;">Can I recommend someone else for the program?</h5>
        <p>Absolutely! If you have a loved one or friend who you think would benefit from HouseCall by Blue, please have them call us at 888-966-3044 (TTY: 711). If they are not already a member of a Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island Medicare Advantage plan, we can help them determine their eligibility and options for becoming a member.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 48px;">For Providers Who Serve Members of Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island</h4>
        <h5 style="margin-top:24px;">What is ConcertoCare?</strong></h5>
        <p>ConcertoCare is an in-home provider of medical, pharmacy, and behavioral services. We have been engaged by Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island to help manage the care of a portion of its Medicare Advantage members, delivered through the HouseCall by Blue program. ConcertoCare does not replace the care that you deliver as a primary care provider or specialist. Instead, our services are intended to help you manage the health of your panel by augmenting the care you provide as part of your existing physician-to-patient relationships.</p>
        <p>Our multidisciplinary teams work with you and your staff to:</p>
        <ul style="margin: 24px 0">
            <li><strong>Help jointly develop and manage care plans</strong> for your patients that encompass the full range of their medical, pharmacy, behavioral, and social needs</li>
            <li><strong>Help your patients with day-to-day activities that allow them to manage their health in between their visits with you</strong> – things like making sure they understand and consistently take their medications, supporting them in self-managing their conditions and knowing when to seek additional care, helping them arrange transportation to medical visits, and more</li>
            <li><strong>Help you stay on top of when your patients need your attention</strong> – for example, when they have a sudden change in health status or have an acute visit</li>
            <li><strong>Help your patients connect with and make use of additional community resources</strong> they can benefit from</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 style="margin-top:24px;">What Does Collaborating With ConcertoCare Look Like?</strong></h5>
        <p>ConcertoCare's teams are here to work with you in service of your patients. Knowing that every practice is unique, we are flexible in our approach to working with you and your team. We can communicate with your practice in whatever way is most seamless – including phone, fax, or EHR-based information sharing.</p>
        <p>Typically, collaboration includes:</p>
        <ul style="margin: 24px 0">
            <li>Pre-visit communication – Whenever a patient opts in to the program and prior to our first visit with them, ConcertoCare will contact the patient’s primary care provider, inform them of our intent to engage with a patient in their practice, and request medical records for pre-visit preparation.</li>
            <li>Post-visit communication – Immediately following all home visits, our teams share documentation and treatment plans with patients' PCPs and/or key specialists, and work to align on the patient's care plan. We also look to coordinate identified patient needs such as orders, referrals, or prescriptions.</li>
            <li>Ongoing communication – Finally, we are available for ongoing collaboration about the care of your patients at any point – for example, to discuss changes to the care plan, changes in patient health status, or transitions of care.</li>
        </ul>
