                        ConcertoCare is an in-home provider of medical, pharmacy, and behavioral services. We have been
                        engaged by Blue Shield of California to help manage the care of a portion of its Health Plan
                        members. ConcertoCare does not replace the care that you deliver as a primary care provider or
                        specialist. Instead, our services are intended to help you manage the health of your panel by
                        augmenting the care you provide as part of your existing physician-to-patient relationships.
